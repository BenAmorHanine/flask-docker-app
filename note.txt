normally , we create a volume that the we can mount to any container(in our case /my-app-data) (if we dont create it when we run docker run -v... or dockercompose : docker creates it for us). it means that us when running a container we can control or create the directory that mounts the data inside of itself ( we are the host) and we create the container for our use. 
for automatic data lounting when the user will not have the task to think about mounting the data in the container to his machine , we use docker compose.
for the /app/data that the data is put there and we map it to the host's directory is created when initializing the image ( step 4 ig is creating the directory /app/data)!!!!!
